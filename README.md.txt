 🎯 Real-Time Emotion Detection Using CNN & OpenCV

This project detects human facial emotions in real-time using a deep learning model trained with convolutional neural networks (CNN). The system works through a webcam and classifies emotions like:

😄 Happy | 😢 Sad | 😡 Angry | 😐 Neutral | 😲 Surprise
