Name: Emotion Detection System (Real-Time AI)
Author: Krishna Goswami
Tech: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, CNN

📌 Description
A real-time Emotion Recognition AI system that detects facial expressions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral & Surprise using a trained deep learning model.
It captures live webcam feed, detects the face, and predicts the emotion instantly using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).


🚀 Features
Live webcam emotion detection
Face detection using OpenCV Haar Cascade
Trained CNN model with 5 emotion classes
Real-time bounding box + label display
Lightweight Python project — easy to run


🧠 Model & Dataset
Custom dataset (5 emotions)
Trained CNN model with good accuracy
